	Clicking on a and using a browser to open a web page is easy and fast, but what’s going on behind the screen is not quite 
as simple. When a link is clicked, the first thing that happens is a request is sent to a server. The request is made up of 
unique parts to specify what the request is asking from the server.  The first part of a link is the protocol, followed by the 
domain, then the endpoint.

	The protocol is usually represented by “HTTPS” or “HTTP” which stands for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure). This part
 of the request tells the server how to read the code being presented to it, and HTTTPS is more secure. Then the protocol uses the
 domain to grab the code to read.
